# RunningTracker Application using Android
Android Application to Track a users physical activities and location using GPS

## Requirements of Application
### Functional Requirements
- The user of the application can control how and when the logging of the distance /
time occurs.
- The user can view the previously logged data in the form of history. The distance data
is stored in the database and made available to the user through an activity component.
- The user can view the maximum distance he has traveled in the entire period the
application has been used.
- The time the user has been jogging for should be captured and stored in the database.
- The data must be stored properly by using content provider.

### Non - Functional Requirements
- Implement a set of target screen resolutions in mind while designing the user interface
of a mobile application.
- Avoid adding the complexity of supporting both portrait and landscape modes if your
application does not need to work in both modes. The application build needs to be
run only on portrait mode.
- The layout may need to be adjusted to increase or decrease the spacing between and
around labels and widgets shown on the screen so as to prevent them from getting
clustered together on high-res screens or spaced apart too much on low-res screens.
